This repo contains the implementation of a simple microprocessor and its addtional ROM and SRAM. The instructions are stored in the ROM and the SRAM can be used to
store data that the CPU can use during its run. This project was part of the Digital Desing Course at KTH Stockholm, part of the Embedded Systems Master Program. 

The implementation is done in SYSTEM VERILOG and was simulated using the MODELSIM software provided by Intel. The instruction set supported by the microprocessor can
be observed in the Microprocessor_Instruction_Set file.
